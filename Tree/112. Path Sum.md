## 112. Path Sum

#### 1. Recursion

```c++
bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
        if(root == NULL) return false;
        if(root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL) return root->val == sum;
        return hasPathSum(root->left, sum - root->val) || hasPathSum(root->right, sum - root->val);
    }
```

Firstly, I don't want to judge if the node is leaf, because I think if the tree is empty and the sum is 0, it should return true.

But according to the requirement, I compromise....
