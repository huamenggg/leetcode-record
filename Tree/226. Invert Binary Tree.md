## 226. Invert Binary Tree

#### 1. Recursion

```c++
TreeNode* invertTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root == NULL ||
            (root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL)) return root;
        else {
            TreeNode *tmp = root->left;
            root->left = invertTree(root->right);
            root->right = invertTree(tmp);
            return root;
        }
    }
```

The thing needs to be noticed is **tmp** , need to store it firstly.

The time consuming is O(n).

#### 2. Iteration

The core is to access every node. If access every node, we can change its child. So if using iteration methods, only to do is to push every node into queue.

```c++
TreeNode* invertTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root == NULL) return root;
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        while(!q.empty()){
            TreeNode* head = q.front();
            q.pop();
            if(head->left == NULL && head->right == NULL) continue;
            TreeNode* tmp = head->left;
            head->left = head->right;
            head->right = tmp;
            if(head->left != NULL)
                q.push(head->left);
            if(head->right != NULL)
                q.push(head->right);
        }
        return root;
    }
```

**Every time using Iteration, needs to consider that if the child is NULL, it can't be push into queue!!!!!!!!**
